- icon buttons locally available in case of no internet connection (should be working, needs testing)
- choose correct song button / popup
- changing song / spamming next song on spotify breaks the app
	- skipping through songs
- rare bug where (korean?) songs 
- Error Handling: 
	-> First: Check for internet connection
	-> Then:
		-getaddrinfo ENOENT open.spotify.com:80
		-undefined
		-
- sidebar with current playing track information from spotify
- MAYBE: let the user locally save certain spotify song / lyric combinations (via spotify song id and genius id) to permanently fix some wrong song recognitions

FIXED:
- update shown song function is being called 3 times initially???
