TODO:
#T1 choose correct song button / popup
#T2 check for internet connection
#T3 sidebar with current playing track information from spotify
	#T3.1 Settings / About pages
#T4 let the user locally save certain spotify song / lyric combinations (via spotify song id and genius id) to permanently fix some wrong song recognitions
#T5 additional lyrics api as alternative to genius.com
#T6 ...

PROBLEMS:
#B4 searching for songs with extra tags in their titles (such as '- live') are giving wrong results or don't work at all
#B5 rare bug where (korean?) songs crash???
#B6 Related to spamming next song the notification toast that says "loading ..." also breaks
#B7 ...

LONG-TERM-PROBLEMS:
#B3 Spamming next song in spotify doesnt break the app anymore but the automatic lyrics changing gets confused.
	- Need to find a way to cancel the function 'updatePlayingSong()' when the track has changed another time
        - Idea: Multithreading: https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/multithreading with web workers

FIXED:
#B1 update shown song function is being called 3 times initially???
#B2 button icons available without internet connection
