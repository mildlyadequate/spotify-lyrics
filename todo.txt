TODO:
- choose correct song button / popup
- check for internet connection
- sidebar with current playing track information from spotify
- let the user locally save certain spotify song / lyric combinations (via spotify song id and genius id) to permanently fix some wrong song recognitions
- additional lyrics api as alternative to genius.com

PROBLEMS:
- searching for songs with extra tags in their titles (such as '- live') are giving wrong results or don't work at all
- rare bug where (korean?) songs crash???
- Related to spamming next song the notification toast that says "loading ..." also breaks

LONG-TERM-PROBLEMS:
-> Spamming next song in spotify doesnt break the app anymore but the automatic lyrics changing gets confused.
	- Need to find a way to cancel the function 'updatePlayingSong()' when the track has changed another time
        - Idea: Multithreading: https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/multithreading with web workers

FIXED:
- update shown song function is being called 3 times initially???
- button icons available without internet connection
